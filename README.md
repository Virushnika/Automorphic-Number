# Automorphic-Number
This Java program checks if a number is Automorphic (a number whose square ends with the number itself). It reads an integer n, calculates its square, and compares the last digits of the square with n using digit count. If they match, it prints "Automorphic"; otherwise, it prints "Not Automorphic".
